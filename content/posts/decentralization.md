## Decentralization

I've been fascinated by the internet since I was a small child using my uncle's old ThinkPad and ruining the Windows installation by installing 400 different cursors (and at least that much malware).

Slowly, as I grew up, I watched the internet change from a place where anything was possible to a place where that idea seems quaint and unlikely. This process seemingly happened all at once, but I believe that's partly to do with the idea that these websites that run our lives (Facebook, Twitter, Google) weren't originally walled gardens where data was hoarded. They were still taking that data, sure, but other's outside of the website could leverage that data as well for things like integrations or interoperability.
